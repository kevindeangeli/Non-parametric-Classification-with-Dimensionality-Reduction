# Non-parametric-Classification-with-Dimensionality-Reduction

Objective: Design non-parametric classifier and compare that with parametric classifiers. Implement both supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction approaches as preprocessing steps to classification. Also practice nomalization as another preprocessing step.
